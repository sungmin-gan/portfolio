**What is the Traveling Salesman Problem?**
The Traveling Salesman Problem poses the following question: "Given a list of cities, and the distances between them, what is the shortest route one can take to visit every city once - and only once - and return to the home city at the end of the trip?" 

**What is Ant Colony Optimization?**
In nature, ants have a peculiar way of finding the shortest route between their nest and their food. First, the colony sends out an exploratory group to scout for food. Once the group finds a food source, they release pheromones on the way home, marking the path between their nest and the food. During their return trip, the ants may encounter an obstacle, or their path may split into multiple paths. When this happens, the ants will split up into equal groups, and circumvent the obstacle or take each of the paths. For example, if a group of 100 ants encounter a rock, 50 would go to the left of the rock, and 50 would go to the right of the rock. Generally, if one of the paths happens to be shorter, the concentration of pheromones on that route tends to be greater than on a longer route. Why? Because more ants can travel along a shorter route in a given span of time than a longer one. Now, imagine that a foraging group encounters the same rock on the way to the food source. As these ants travel their paths, they release pheromones as well. How do they decide which route to take around the rock? They divide themselves in groups proportional to the concentration of pheromones on each route. For example, if the shorter route had a pheromone level of 66%, and the longer one 34%, about 66% of the ants will follow the shorter route, and the rest will follow the longer route. Thus, the shorter path will continuously receive a higher concentration of pheromones, until it becomes an established route that all or most of the ants will use. 

**How is Ant Colony Optimization used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem?**
The "ants" used in this AI program have 2 distinct advantages over real ants. One, they will never visit a city that they have visited before. Two, they know the distances between each city, and tend to travel to cities that are closest to them. One feature they share with real ants is that they release pheromones along the routes, and tend to choose routes higher in pheromone content. A well proportioned combination of these three factors helps the ants "sniff" out the most optimal route fairly efficiently. With the help of visual tools like Python's Turtle Module, we can see this process in action:

Routes become thicker as they are used more and more, and they change from red, to yellow, to green when the colony starts establishing that route permanently.
