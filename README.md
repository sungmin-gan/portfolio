# Welcome to my portfolio!

A short description of my works:

-> TutorTree Samples

TutorTree is a web app that helps connect university students who are able to tutor, to other students who need tutoring. As a web developer intern, I helped develop CDN injections in JavaScript for things like rendering pages, error checking forms, and streamlining state representation processes. My work also included creating backend functions in Python to automate features like email campaigns. I've included a link for live demonstrations in the first comments of some of the samples.

-> Ant Colony Optimization

This was my final project for an Articial Intelligence class. In a nutshell, ACO helps find the shortest route between two points, while passing through a network of nodes. It incorporates a biological system that ants use for accomplishing a similar task. You can find more details in the project's README.
