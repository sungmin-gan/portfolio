# A short description of my works:

-> TutorTree Samples

[TutorTree](https://tutortree.com) is a web app that acts as a "matchmaker" between students who need tutoring, and those who can offer it within the same university. As a web developer intern, I helped develop CDN injections in JavaScript for tasks such as rendering web pages, error checking forms, and streamlining state representation processes. My work also included creating backend functions in Python to automate features like email campaigns. 

-> C++ Node Basics

Simple node operations such as stacking and queuing with C++. Academic work. 

-> Ant Colony Optimization

This was my final project for an Articial Intelligence class. In a nutshell, ACO helps find the shortest route between two points, while passing through a network of nodes. It incorporates a biological system that ants use for accomplishing a similar task. You can find more details in the project's README.
